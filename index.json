    "title": "DataBinder | BlazorWebFormsComponents",
    "keywords": "DataBinder In Web Forms applications, there is a somewhat standard approach of formatting and placing data in controls by using the DataBinder object. The DataBinder would be used in ItemTemplate, AlternatingItemTemplate, and other control templates to indicate where data would be formatted and placed. Microsoft's original documentation about the DataBinder are available. ASP .NET Syntax, Support and Migration There are several common techniques that the DataBinder was used and various levels of support are provided: Web Forms Syntax Description Blazor Support DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, \"PropertyName\") Output the PropertyName of the current item Fully Supported for Container.DataItem Eval(\"PropertyName\") Output the PropertyName of the current item Fully Supported when using static DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, \"PropertyName\", \"FormatString\") Output the formatted value of PropertyName of the current item with the FormatString Fully Supported for Container.DataItem Eval(\"PropertyName\", \"FormatString\") Output the formatted value of PropertyName of the current item with the FormatString Fully Supported when using static DataBinder.GetDataItem Output the item currently operated on Not supported: Replace with calls to @context DataBinder.GetPropertyValue(Container.DataItem, \"PropertyName\") Get the property requested as an object for further handling Only supported when passing in @context for the first argument. Recommendation : replace with @context.PropertyName to directly access the property in a strongly-typed manner Back to top Support and Migration The DataBinder is not recommended by Microsoft in Web Forms for use in high-performance applications due to the amount of reflection used to output and format content. Similarly, we do not recommend long-term use of the DataBinder and have marked it with an Obsolete flag indicating that there are methods to easily migrate syntax to be more Razor-performance-friendly. Back to top Usage To migrate your Web Forms control that is referencing the DataBinder to Blazor, start with syntax similar to the following: <ItemTemplate> <li><%#: DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, \"Price\", \"{0:C}\") %></li> </ItemTemplate> All of the databound components in this library support DataBinder syntax and can easily be converted by replacing the angle brackets with razor notation like the following: <ItemTemplate> <li>@DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, \"Price\", \"{0:C}\")</li> </ItemTemplate> That's a VERY simple conversion and its clear how we can continue to deliver the same feature and formatting using Blazor. You can even shorten the syntax to use the simple Eval keyword and get the same effect. Just include a @using static keyword near the top of your Blazor page with this syntax and you can using the shortened format of Eval . @using static BlazorWebFormsComponents.DataBinder ... <ItemTemplate> <li>@Eval(\"Price\", \"{0:C}\")</li> </ItemTemplate> Note: Your Blazor application will emit compiler warnings while you continue to use the DataBinder. Back to top Moving On Moving on from the DataBinder to a more performant and simple Razor syntax is quite easy using an ItemContext and referencing the iterated item directly. This approach has the additional benefit of providing type-safety and compiler checking on the content of your Blazor pages. Our Eval(\"Price\") statement above is further simplified into: <Repeater Context=\"Item\"> ... <ItemTemplate> <li>@Item.Price.ToString(\"C\")</li> </ItemTemplate> ... </Repeater> Back to top"

    "href": "articles/UtilityFeatures/ViewState.html",
    "title": "ViewState | BlazorWebFormsComponents",
    "keywords": "ViewState One of the most abused and misunderstood features of ASP .NET Web Forms is ViewState. Originally designed to help stateful Visual Basic 6 Windows application developers migrate to the web, this feature delivered a lot of heartache to developers who didn't fully understand and limit its usage appropriately in their web applications. In Web Forms, every Page and every Control carries a ViewState object that contains the state of the Control or Page at the time of request, serialized and output as an HTML hidden input tag. Without proper diligence in selecting which controls and features need their state tracked, many applications found this HTML tag fill up with megabytes of serialized code and slowing their applications. Elsewhere in Web Forms, ViewState could be used as a key/value store to place data that should be remembered during the current fetch/post/retrieve cycle for a page. You would find syntax like the following in Pages and Controls to add the bar object with a key named foo : ViewState.Add(\"foo\", bar); or to fetch the item named foo from ViewState: ViewState[\"foo\"] It's a simple syntax and implements a typical Dictionary pattern. After the PreRender phase of a Page, the content would be serialized and inserted into an HTML hidden input so that it would be available when the Page was posted. Implementation In BlazorWebFormsComponents, we want to preserve this API but provide a proper Blazor implementation. To do this, we have provided a basic Dictionary<string,object> property called ViewState that you can add items to and retrieve from. This ViewState is preserved for the duration of the life of the component as your user interacts with it. This is an in-memory storage on the server (in the case of server-side Blazor) or in the Browser as part of Blazor Web-Assembly. You can see the implementation in the BaseWebFormsComponent class. Moving On ViewState is not a feature you should continue to use after migrating. While we have already eliminated the serializeation / deserialization performance issue with ViewState, we still recommend moving any storage you do with ViewState to class-scoped fields and properties that can be validated and strongly-typed. This will also reduce the boxing/unboxing performance issue that exists with ViewState. You would define the property for Foo with a syntax similar to, substituting the proper type of bar for BarType : protected BarType Foo { get; set; } The interaction above would be updated to the following syntax in your component's class: // Store bar for retrieval later Foo = bar; // Fetch bar for use bar = Foo;"

Needs links to the .NET Standard specifications and repository on GitHub Class libraries can be built and target different version specifications of .NET Standard. You can target ANY version of .NET Standard and gain compatibility across .NET Framework and .NET Core, but we recommend you target at least .NET Standard 2.0 Add image showing compatibility table of .NET Standard Implications For your existing Web Forms applications, unless you are executing unsafe code or p-invoking methods, you should be able to migrate much of your application's business logic to a .NET Standard targeting class library. This has several benefits: You can migrate your business logic to the .NET Standard class library project, reference that project, and continue to use that logic in your ASP .NET Web Forms application. Your new .NET Standard class library project can be DIRECTLY referenced by your migrated ASP .NET Core / Server-side Blazor application Your business logic code is now isolated from your presentation code, and should be more testable. Write some unit tests to verify that your business logic is behaving properly. If you'd like to write a mobile application to work with your web application, you can re-use your .NET Standard project with the Xamarin frameworks. Sample 1: Update an existing class library The first sample demonstrates updating a simple class library to .NET Standard. In this model, we're assuming that you already have your business logic code properly separated from your user-interface and managed inside a class-library project that targets .NET Framework 4.5. You can find the source and directions for this sample in the samples/netstandard-1 folder. Sample 2: Refactoring Business Logic The second sample shows how to take an existing ASP .NET application and refactor our some business logic as a .NET Standard project.

    "keywords": "Web Forms Application Migration Readiness This document is intended as a primer for prospective teams to review in preparation for migrating their Web Forms applications to Server-Side Blazor. We believe the migration is a multi-step process and this application review and preparation is the first step in migrating / rewriting an application using Blazor. Definitions Throughout this document, we will refer to several framework and technology terms. This section will clarify those terms. Web Forms The ASP .NET user-interface technology that started with the release in 2002 and is typically identified by applications with web pages that have a .ASPX file-extension MVC Model-View-Controller architecture introduced in 2009 as an alternative user-interface framework for ASP .NET developers. A project structure that uses the MVC framework typically has 3 or 4 folders in it named Areas , Models , Views , Controllers Razor Views The template technology uses by modern ASP .NET MVC and ASP .NET Core applications. Typically, these files are found in the Views folder and have a .cshtml file-extension High-Level Requirements ASPX in-line Visual Basic not supported on Razor components in .NET Core Convert to C# or move out to a class library No data source controls on ASPX pages Business logic needs to be convertible to .NET Core Class libraries referenced need to be convertible to .NET Standard No 3rd party control libraries that don't have a shim for conversion (none available at the time of this writing) Application architecture suggestions Prefer model-binding techniques over handling Form life-cycle events like Init , Load , PreRender , and Unload These event-handlers do not exist and function the same way in Blazor. Avoid acting outside of the Load event. The actions you are taking in Load can be executed at the conclusion of the Initialize event in Blazor Use a repository pattern with interfaces declared for the repositories Inject the concrete implementation of the data access technology. It MAY change to HTTP access at some point in the future Minimal code embedded in ASPX files - this code will need to be updated to work with the components, where they were using full-featured controls. No calls through the control hierarchy. E.g. FindControl() Any hybrid applications that contains both MVC and Web Forms user interface content will take some extra work to be converted, as the MVC components will need to be converted to ASP .NET Core System.Confuguration.ConfigurationManager access will need to be rewritten to use Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfiguration objects that are injected Push configuration access to a repository class object that can be migrated to the new Configuration model in .NET Core HttpContext.Current access will need to be reevaluated. Direct HttpContext access should be avoided in Blazor Custom components will need to be rewritten User controls .ASCX files should be converted to Blazor components HttpHandlers and HttpModules will need to be rewritten as ASP .NET Core middleware MasterPages can be converted to Layout components Mobile device detection is not available as part of Blazor. Site.mobile.master will not be directly used by the framework. Instead of using an alternate rendering strategy for mobile, we recommend you embrace an adaptive rendering strategy to ensure that mobile device visitors to your application get a good experience"

    "title": "Migration Strategies | BlazorWebFormsComponents",
    "keywords": "Migration Strategies Migration from ASP .NET Web Forms to Blazor is not simple and this repository attempts to make it easier for developers to reuse as much of their Web Forms application as possible. The two technologies are 'concept compatible', but run on different implementations of the .NET runtime (.NET Framework vs. .NET Core / .NET 5+) We, the maintainers of this project, believe that with a little ingenuity the markup from a Web Forms application can be copied over with minimal changes and function similarly to its original purpose. We believe that well formatted and maintained code in Web Forms should be easily migrated. Applications that are a significant mix of C# and markup will have a more difficult time going through this process. Readiness Planning Migrating an application to Blazor is not a trivial process and it would be great to have some indication ahead of time how much work is needed and what steps you need to take to prepare to migrate. Check our migration readiness document to help determine how much work will be needed for your application to begin the process. Known Required Changes There are several changes that are going to need to be made to the markup in your ASPX and ASCX files in order to get them working. Some of these are obvious changes, and some are considerations necessary for the razor templating and Blazor rendering engine. Visual Basic converted to C# Blazor uses razor templates which only support the C# language. All Visual Basic in the markup will need to be converted to C#. Bee-sting notation <% %> needs to be converted to @() notation ASP .NET famously wrapped all .NET code in <% %>. Starting with ASP .NET MVC and razor templates, all C# code is wrapped in @() syntax. _Imports files needed In order to match some of the syntax previously available in Web Forms markup, a series of using static statements are necessary to allow the appropriate shims to work with your markup. You can find our sample of the _Imports.razor file here: INSERT LINK User Controls (ASCX files) need to be converted to components Components are the building blocks for Blazor, just as controls were in Web Forms. If you have user controls in your application, you will need to convert those to components. See the UserControl strategy below for more details. MasterPages are no more The concept of a MasterPage does not exist in Blazor. Instead, your ASPX pages will be loaded inside of a host page. You can compose a razor component that hosts other converted ASPX pages but your pages cannot dictate their parent container. See the MasterPage strategy below for more details. Page Directive Changes No <%#: DataBinding expressions Databinding expressions in Web Forms let you evaluate the content of the elements and format them appropriately for presentation. For editor controls, it also allows you to setup a 2-way binding so that you can receive values entered into the same variable bound to the control. In Blazor, for repeater-style components, just format the variable using context, Item, and simple formatting like this: @Item.ShipDate.ToString(\"D\") For editor components, simply @bind the variable to the component. This will give you two-way data-binding and the ability to handle changes in the editor component AS it changes. <input type=\"text\" name=\"foo\" @bind=\"bar\" /> No Namespaces, No Tag-Prefixes Namespaces and tag-prefixes are gone. You can do a Find and Replace on asp: and remove those from your markup. Redirect Color to WebColor This change should NOT require any coding modifications. In Web Forms, you could refer to System.Drawing.Color objects when setting BackColor , BorderColor , and ForeColor to name a few properties. You could ALSO freely use HTML hex-color notation freely in these fields. The System.Drawing.Color object does not have a converter that allows you to convert between these two formats, so we wrapped the object and made BlazorWebFormsComponents.WebColor that performs the same task and allows the interchange of System.Drawing.Color object with HTML hex notation.

This process is not 100% and is not guaranteed to deliver a Blazor application without some amount of rewriting. Applications are written in many different ways, and the tools provided here are attempting to get your project CLOSE to Blazor so that you have to rewrite as little code as possible. Back to top Step 1 - Readiness There are good application architectures and there are not-so-good application architectures to be considered for migration to Blazor. We've written another document to help you evaluate the readiness of your application for migration . It is recommended you read through that documentation to understand what makes an application better prepared for migration to Blazor. Back to top Step 2 - Migrate Business Logic to .NET Standard .NET Standard is the new recommended way to package and reuse business logic across projects and .NET runtimes. We recommend you migrate: Any class libraries referenced Any classes in your web project that do NOT directly communicate with the web request or response There is a separate strategy document with instructions to migrate your code to .NET Standard libraries. The goal of the exercise is to place all of your business logic into .NET Standard 2.0 libraries. This version of .NET Standard will allow you to reference the libraries in both your existing Web Forms application and in your new Blazor application. A side benefit : this is a good architecture practice that should allow you to test your business logic independently from your web project. Try starting a unit test project with xUnit, NUnit or MSTest to exercise some of your business logic. You will be able to run your tests either in the Visual Studio Test Runner or at the command line using dotnet test Back to top Step 3 - Create a new Blazor Server Project Create your new Blazor Server-Side project either in Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio for Mac, or at the command line. With Visual Studio, follow these steps: ADD IMAGES At the command-line you can execute the following command to create your Blazor Server-Side project: dotnet new blazorserver -f netcoreapp3.1 -o <<DESTINATION FOLDER>> Add a NuGet reference to the BlazorWebFormsComponents package on the command-line as follows: dotnet add package Fritz.BlazorWebFormsComponents Next, add references to the projects converted to .NET Standard in the previous step. In Visual Studio, follow these steps: ADD IMAGES On the command-line you can add references using the dotnet CLI tools in your Blazor Server-Side project folder with syntax like: dotnet add reference ../MyLibrary For more details, see the official .NET documentation for adding references . Next, add a using statement in the existing ./_Imports.razor file for the BlazorWebFormsComponents: @using BlazorWebFormsComponents This will allow you to reference the components from the library directly. Without this statement you would have to create tags that look like <BlazorWebFormsComponents.ListView and that's just ugly. We want the simpler <ListView syntax that matches the markup used in ASP .NET Back to top Step 4 - Master Pages Master Pages in Web Forms are a combination of two concepts in Blazor: a host page and a Blazor layout. In Blazor Server-Side the host page is a razor page by default in Pages/_Host.cshtml that bootstraps the Blazor application and hosts all static CSS and JavaScript references. You will want to place any CSS or JavaScript references from your MasterPages into this host page. The rest of your MasterPage layout will need to be migrated to a layout razor file. In the simplest scenario where you have one MasterPage with ONLY HTML content and it has one main content area, you will want to overwrite the content in Shared/MainLayout.razor For more complex scenarios, read the MasterPages strategy documentation . Back to top Step 5 - User Controls User Controls in Web Forms are identified by their .ascx extension and inclusion in other controls or pages. These controls most closely resemble Blazor components: Mixture of HTML and code Inline functions in file with markup Potential 'code-behind' partial class with more coded logic Components have no direct reference to the structure and contents of the parent Page or MasterPage. If your controls rely on this capability of Web Forms, you will want to instead pass around a CascadingValue that your controls can receive as a CascadingParameter . Components also do not have ViewState. We are considering implementing a ViewState-like object to help with conversion . If you were storing the state of things in ControlState or ViewState we recommend allocating a class-level field or parameter to store those values. We recommend copying your HTML and code into a YOURCOMPONENT.razor file with the same name and place it in the same folder structure under a Components folder as was located in your web forms project. You can omit the <% control directive at the top of the file. You should then migrate any methods to a YOURCOMPONENT.razor.cs partial class. References to <asp: components can be easily edited to use the matching components with these steps: More information and advanced techniques can be found in the User Controls strategy document Back to top Step 6 - Pages Copy ASPX and ASPX.cs files into Pages folder Rename and convert to razor and razor.cs Back to top Step 7 - Custom Controls At this time, these controls will need to be re-written to target the ComponentBase class instead. We have an issue opened to look into making migration of these classes easier , but it is targeted for later in the project. More information and strategy for re-writing these controls can be found in the custom controls strategy document . Back to top Step X - Convert inline Visual Basic Use the tool from Telerik at: https://converter.telerik.com/ Back to top Follow-up: Move components to Razor Component Library Back to top"

    "keywords": "BlazorWebFormsComponents A collection of Blazor components that emulate the web forms components of the same name. Purpose These components are made available with the intent to help brown-field application developers. These components are intended to help an application that already exists and would like to be able to migrate it more easily and without a complete rewrite to the latest version of Blazor so that you can extend your support opportunities as well as consider the possibility of using alternate renderings and even running within WebAssembly. This is NOT intended to be used for new applications, and you will find that some of the rendering delivered by these controls is considered \"bad practice\" by 2020 web standards. This is by design in order to ensure compatibility with the original controls delivered with ASP.NET Web Forms. Contents This folder contains information about each of the components that emulate the original controls, as well as documentation about how to use them together to enhance your existing application. Hopefully, with a little bit of work you will be able to make the conversion to Blazor."
