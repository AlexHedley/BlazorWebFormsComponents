# Contributing to BlazorWebFormsComponents

Thank you for taking the time to consider contributing to our project.  

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the project.  These are mostly guidelines, not rules, and can be changed in the future.  Please submit your suggestions with a pull-request to this document.

## Code of Conduct

We have adopted a code of conduct from the Contributor Covenant.  Contributors to this project are expected to adhere to this code.  Please report unwanted behavior to [jeff@jeffreyfritz.com](mailto:jeff@jeffreyfritz.com)

## What should I know before I get started?

This project is currently a single library that will provide a shim, a buffer that will help you convert markup to run in Blazor. The project will grow in the future to support more automated conversion from ASP<span></span>.NET Web Forms to Blazor.

### Project Folder Structure

This project is designed to be built and run primarily with Visual Studio 2019. The folders are configured so that they will support editing and working in other editors and on non-Windows operating systems.  We encourage you to develop with these other environments, because we would like to be able to support developers who use those tools as well.  The folders are configured as follows:

```
/docs         -- User Documentation
/samples      -- Usage Samples 
  BeforeWebForms
  AfterBlazorClientSide
  AfterBlazorServerSide
/src          -- Library source and unit tests
  BlazorWebFormsComponents
  BlazorWebFormsComponents.Test
```

We may add a top level `tests` folder if there are integration tests to show at some point.

All official versions of the project are built and delivered with Azure DevOps Pipelines and linked in the main README.md and [releases tab in GitHub](https://github.com/FritzAndFriends/BlazorWebFormsComponents/releases).

### Design Decisions

Design for this project is ultimately decided by the project lead, [Jeff Fritz](https://github.com/csharpfritz).  The following project tenets are adhered to when making decisions:

1. All attributes of the original controls should be supported. This helps emphasize the 'convert your markup' feature. 
1. HTML markup generated by the components should replicate the markup generated by the original controls.  This helps to ensure the components behave as the Web Forms controls were expected to.
1. Minimal .NET APIs should be supported, in order to present the API.  The following are the primary APIs available:
    1. Component events: OnInit, OnLoad, OnPrerender, OnUnload
    1. DataBind()
1. The following APIs and Controls will NOT be supported:
    1. **DataSources** - These are components that provide connectivity to a data source.  In Blazor, this code should be moved to a Repository pattern and classes.  You can still connect that Repository to the components and work with the data.
    1. **ViewState** - There is no viewstate in Blazor.  ViewState is marked obsolete on components, and state of your interactions with the controls should be stored in private variables or Session.
    1. **Postback** - There is no postback in Blazor, therefore we will not support this feature.
